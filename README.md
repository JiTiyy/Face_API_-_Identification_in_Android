**This is a repository for an Android app that uses the [Microsoft Face API](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/face/) for facial detection and  identification.** Features of this app include:



- **Detecting** faces in an image and drawing a box around them.
- **Indentifying** faces in an image and placing their name next to their face.




###### Please Note: The process of adding people to Person Groups is done through a Console Application found in my other repository called [Face API - Visual Studio.](https://github.com/ishaanjav/Face_API_-_Visual_Studio)
