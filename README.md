# Face_API_-_Indentification_in_Android
**This is a repository for an Android app that uses the Microsoft Face API for facial detection and then identification.** Features of this app include:
- Detecting faces in an image and drawing a box around them.
- Indentifying faces in an image and placing their name next to their face.
###### Please Note: The process of adding people to Person Groups is done through a Console Application found in my other repository called [Face API - Visual Studio.](https://github.com/ishaanjav/Face_API_-_Visual_Studio)
